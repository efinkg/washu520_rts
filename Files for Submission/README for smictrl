System Management Interrupts are pretty cool in non-real-time systems.
In real-time systems, SMIs interrupt the CPU for an unacceptably long duration of time, so they should be disabled.
Smictrl is a handy utility for controlling (and disabling) SMI.

Get smictrl using the following command:

git clone git://git.kiszka.org/smictrl.git

Open the smictrl folder and compile smictrl using the following command:

make

Disable SMI bits using the following command:

sudo ./smictrl -s 0
